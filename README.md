# House Price Prediction
> The primary objective of this project is to build a robust regression model using regularization techniques. This model will enable Surprise Housing to predict the actual values of prospective properties, aiding the company in making informed investment decisions. The specific goals include identifying significant variables that influence house prices, assessing the model's predictive power, and determining the optimal values of lambda for both ridge and lasso regression.
